# RuneswickChronicles

Welcome to the Runeswick Chronicles Github Repository. This is a student made game with most assets being pulled from the Unity asset store. While this is a student project we tried our best to only use assets that had a free use tag on them meaning that even if we decide to change the game for release at a later date we have nothing we need to change.
